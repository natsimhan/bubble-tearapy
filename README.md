## Requirements

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is required to install dependencies and run scripts via `npm`.

## Available Commands

| Command               | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|

| `yarn dev`            | Launch a development web server |
| `yarn build`          | Create a production build in the `dist` folder |


## Deploying to Production

After you run the `yarn build` command, your code will be built into a single bundle and saved to the `dist` folder, along with any other assets your project imported, or stored in the public assets folder.

In order to deploy your game, you will need to upload *all* of the contents of the `dist` folder to a public facing web server.
